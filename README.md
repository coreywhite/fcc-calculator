# fcc-calculator
Free Code Camp - Advanced Front End Project - Javascript Calculator

Made for Free Code Camp.

## Requirements

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/PNKdjo/.

Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.

User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

## Notes

I chose to emulate some of the unusual behaviors of a real pocket calculator, which led to somewhat complex code. A large set of QUnit tests formalizes the behavior I was trying to obtain.
